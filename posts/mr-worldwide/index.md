# Introducing Mr.Worldwide
date = 2019-01-20T18:50:33+01:00

To help with a little investigation of mine regarding international languages support in [eDEX-UI](https://github.com/GitSquared/edex-ui), I wanted to analyze a font file to see how many alphabets and languages it could support.

After a bit of [ducking](https://duckduckgo.com) around, I couldn't find an online tool that did this properly, so I built my own: **[Mr. Worldwide](https://github.com/GitSquared/mrworldwide)**.

</p>

Mr.Worldwide analyzes the writing systems supported by a font (support of specific unicode ranges corresponding to regional languages) and displays the results in a way that is easy to understand at a glance - a colored world map.

The name is of course a reference to the 2011 [meme](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/mr-worldwide) - I take great pride in gaving any piece of software I build the shittiest name possible\*. The tool itself is only one, sort-of-lengthy, browser-side javascript file that uses a lot of bleeding edge web APIs like [FontFaceSet](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FontFaceSet) for dynamically loading fonts in the webpage.

The overall look of the interface is ~~shamelessly stolen~~ inspired from [Zeit.co's datacenter ping tests](https://iad.zeit.co) - I'm a real fan of their modern, high contrast designs on their websites and panels, and wanted to try and borrow a bit from that. Which turned out to not just be "a bit" but whatever, at least it doesn't look (too) ugly.

Let's dive into the code, shall we?
## #01: Loading a custom font from a file, with drag & drop for the wow factor

The first step in the tool's workflow is to get a web font file from the user and load it up into the browser so it can be tested.

I wanted to make an intuitive, drag & drop experience - something I never actually looked into before - and it turned out to be really easy to implement, considering this tool only targets ultra-modern browsers so I didn't have to worry too much about compatibility.

First, we use the [drag&drop HTML API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTML_Drag_and_Drop_API) and specifically the [DataTransfer property](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/DataTransfer) of the `drop` event to get a file from the user.

```js
function initApp() {
    var dropper = document.getElementById("dragdrop");
    var icon = document.getElementById("dragdrop-icon");

    dropper.ondragover = e => {
        e.preventDefault();
    };
    dropper.ondrop = e => {
        e.preventDefault();

        dropper.ondrop = null;

        var dt = e.dataTransfer;
        if (dt.files.length !== 1) {
            icon.setAttribute("src", "assets/no.svg");
            setTimeout(initApp, 1000);
        } else {
            // We have the file in dt.files[0]
        }
    };
}
```

The `preventDefault()`s on dragover & drop are needed to ensure that those events won't be handled by the browser, which would open the file in a new tab. If more than one file is dropped, a "denied" symbol is displayed for a second, and then the app's logic is restarted.

Now, we need to get the binary data from the file. For this, we're going to use the [FileReader API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FileReader), like this:

```js
var fr = new FileReader();
fr.onerror = () => {
    // Read failed, restart.
    icon.setAttribute("src", "assets/no.svg");
    setTimeout(initApp, 1000);
};

fr.onload = e => {
    var buffer = e.target.result;
    /* buffer is an ArrayBuffer with the binary
     data from the dropped file. */
};
			
// We got our handlers in place; start reading.
fr.readAsArrayBuffer(dt.files[0]);
```

Reading the file as an [ArrayBuffer](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/ArrayBuffer) allows us to feed it to the (experimental) [FontFace API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FontFace), which allows us to programmatically create new fonts and load them into the webpage - it's the same thing as defining a `@font-face` rule in CSS, but from Javascript.

```js
var buffer = e.target.result;
window.testFont = new FontFace("testFont", buffer);
```

Creating a new FontFace object never raises an error with the current spec/implementations, but that doesn't mean it worked all right: we didn't do any input check, so we're not even sure that the file provided is indeed a loadable web font.

Thankfully, FontFace objects have a `status` property - it can take the values `"unloaded"`, `"loading"`, `"loaded"`, or `"error"` (at time of writing, keep in mind this is not a fully stable API yet). By checking for `FontFace.status === "error"`, we can use the FontFace constructor as an input validator, like so:

```js
window.testFont = new FontFace("testFont", buffer);
if (window.testFont.status === "error") {
	// Bad font file or unsupported format, restart.
    icon.setAttribute("src", "assets/no.svg");
    setTimeout(initApp, 1000);
} else {
    // window.testFont is valid and ready to be loaded.
}
```

Now that we're sure everything is all right, we can load the font using the [FontFaceSet API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FontFaceSet). The document-wide FontFaceSet can be accessed with `document.fonts`.

```js
// window.testFont is valid and ready to be loaded.
document.fonts.add(window.testFont);

/* FontFaceSet.load() requires a font size, but it is arbitrary at
the moment, the "12px" value doesn't have any importance. */
document.fonts.load("12px testFont");
```

And voil√†! The dropped file has been validated and loaded into the document's font set. We can use it in CSS as `testFont`.

## #02: Getting the required data for the tests

</p>

*Geographic distribution of the most used writing systems, source: [wikipedia](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:World_alphabets_%26_writing_systems.svg)*

Before actually testing anything, I first needed data on which writing systems were used in the world, where were they used, and the range of [Unicode characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode) needed for each one of them. I couldn't find a compiled list that referenced the unicode ranges needed to write in modern scripts by family, so I spent a few hours making my own by looking at the map above and lists of Unicode blocks used by each major writing system, like [this one for the Latin scripts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_script_in_Unicode).

The end result is JSON data listing all the character ranges needed to write modern text in each of the world's most commonly used writing systems:

```json
{
    "latin": [
        [0, 127],
        [128, 255],
        [256, 383],
        [384, 591],
        [7680, 7935]
    ],
    "cyrillic": [
        [1024, 1279],
        [1280, 1327],
        [7467, 7544],
        [65070, 65071]
    ],
    ...others
}
```
*Note: you may notice that currently non-displayable characters like ASCII control chars are not excluded from the lists; hopefully someday I'll take the time to filter those out.*

## #03: Testing the font

Back to the script. We have a font to test and the code of the characters to test it with; now how do we find out which ones are supported and which ones aren't? Well, try to write them, of course!

But there's one small problem: web browsers use a cascading fallback font system, which means that if the selected font can't display a character, the next choosen font is used, and so on until a font is found - either in the font's custom page or in the system's font set - that can display the problematic char. If absolutely no suitable font is found, a "?" symbol is displayed instead.

To prevent the browser from displaying characters not supported by our test font, Mr.Worldwide uses [Adobe Blank](https://github.com/adobe-fonts/adobe-blank). Blank is a special font made for testing purposes that maps every character to a blank, zero-width one. By setting it as the secondary font for our testing node, we can make sure that trying to write any non-supported character will make said node have a `0px` width.

```css
p#tester {
	font-family: testFont, Blank;
}
```

And here's the actual testing:

```js
// Get an empty 'p' element to test our font.
var tester = document.getElementById("tester");

/* We linked the Blank font in our HTML, but since no text uses
it on the page, the browser may not have loaded it yet. */
document.fonts.load("12px Blank").then(() => {
	
    // We'll use a global object to store the results of our tests.
    window.testFontUnicodeCoverage = {};

	/* window.scripts is the object containing the JSON data
    listing unicode ranges by scripts (writing systems), the
    following code allows us to loop through each script. */
    Object.keys(window.scripts).forEach(scriptName => {
    	
        // Will store the number of succesfully rendered glyphs.
        let success = 0;
        // Will store the total number of glyphs for this script.
        let divisor = 0;

        // Loop through each unicode range used in this script:
        window.scripts[scriptName].forEach(range => {
        	
            /* Add the total number of glyphs in this range
            to our divisor. */
            divisor = divisor + (range[1] - range[0]);

            // Loop through each individual unicode character:
            for (let i = range[0]; i <= range[1]; i++) {

            	// Write the character to our test node.
                tester.textContent = String.fromCodePoint(i);

                /* If a character is rendered, increment the
                number of successfully rendered glyphs. */
                if (tester.offsetWidth > 0) {
                    success++;
                }
             }
        });

		/* Calculate & store a float representing the percentage
        of this writing system that is supported by our
        test font. */
        let successRate = success / divisor;
        window.testFontUnicodeCoverage[s] = successRate;
    });
});
```
*You might be interested in learning more about [Object.keys](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/keys), which is used to loop through the values of an object, and [String.fromCodePoint](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/fromCodePoint), which allows creating a string from unicode character codes in hexa- or decimal format.*

The test results are stored in a global object `window.testFontUnicodeCoverage` that gives the percentage of script support for each writing system, like so:

```json
{
	"arabic": 0.17299820954677847,
    "armenian": 0,
    "brahmic": 0,
    "canadianSyllabic": 0,
    "cjk": 0,
    "cyrillic": 0.5146058024865757,
    "ethiopic": 0,
    "gana+kana": 0,
    "georgian": 0,
    "greek": 0.7601562335069727,
    "hangul": 0,
    "hebrew": 0.8966550340600317,
    "latin": 0.9126691936883361,
    "thaana": 0.17299820954677847
}
```

## #03: Displaying results

<p align="center">
	<img alt="Example result graph" src="{{ URL }}/res/example-result.png"/>
</p>

To display the results on a world map, I made an `svg` element representing a world map with countries outlined and `class` attributes on each country with the name of the most used writing system there.

The JS script can then apply the right colors simply by appending a style element with calculated `opacity` values:

```js
let style = document.createElement("style");
style.innerHTML = `
	.latin {
    	fill: #0076ff;
        fill-opacity: ${window.testFontUnicodeCoverage.latin};
    }
    (...)
`;

document.body.appendChild(style);
```

The color scale at the bottom was made simply with a CSS `linear-gradient` background in a `span` element.

And that's it! You can [test the tool](https://gitsquared.github.io/mrworldwide) or [look at the code on GitHub](https://github.com/GitSquared/mrworldwide).

***Thanks for reading and hope you enjoyed this. I'm looking forward to publish more tech write-ups like this, notably about [eDEX-UI](https://github.com/GitSquared/edex-ui), since I got a few requests for that one.***
