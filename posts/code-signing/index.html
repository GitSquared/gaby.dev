			<p><strong>tl;dr: Desktop software signing is like SSL used to be not so long ago: both extremely interesting for end-users and developers alike, but too expensive for anyone not running a business.</strong></p>
<hr>
<p>Earlier today, I was looking at the issues left on <a href="https://github.com/GitSquared/edex-ui">eDEX-UI</a>, and decided to work on <a href="https://github.com/GitSquared/edex-ui/issues/278">#278</a> - &quot;Implementing an internal self-update mechanism&quot;.</p>
<p>After a bit of thinking and research, I ended up dropping the idea, even though it would in theory be easy to implement: there is the nice, built-in Electron <a href="https://electronjs.org/docs/api/auto-updater">autoUpdate</a> API, but I&#39;d need to code-sign the releases first, and while there is also the <a href="https://www.electron.build/auto-update">electron-builder way</a> that does not require signing, I just don&#39;t feel that the added security risks are worth it.</p>
<p>A little background explanation: Code-signing is a process by which a developer use certified cryptographic keys to digitally sign binaries before shipping software to end-users. The OS verifies that the signature is valid before installing/running the software, and it ensures that the code hasn&#39;t been messed with between the original release and the version downloaded by the user.</p>
<p>The whole thing drastically improves security, especially in context of self-updating apps that may be susceptible to mitm/fake server attacks; you may wonder why it hasn&#39;t been implemented on eDEX yet - indeed, when you try to install it on either macOS or Windows, you are prompted with a warning pop-up telling you that you&#39;re trying to install unverified software published by an unknown developer (that would be me).</p>
<p align="center">

</p>

<p>Well, the &quot;problem&quot; is, to get a certified key to sign your code with, you need to grab your wallet. Apple has the all-included <a href="https://developer.apple.com/programs">Apple Developer Program</a>, which costs <strong>99 US$/year</strong>. Think that&#39;s bad? It&#39;s really not.</p>
<p>In the Microsoft world - and keep in mind <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usage_share_of_operating_systems#Desktop_and_laptop_computers">Windows has &gt;80% of the market shares in desktop OSs</a> (sadly) - certificates have to be obtained through external providers like <a href="https://www.digicert.com/code-signing/microsoft-authenticode.htm">Digicert</a>, for instance, who will happily provide you with nothing more than the certificate at the wonderful cost of &quot;just&quot; <strong>474 US$/year</strong>.</p>
<p>Now, as a young student maintaining a piece of free and open-source software that has got 30 000 downloads in less than a month, I&#39;m not exactly swimming in money right now - there&#39;s an operating cost, both in server fees and valuable time, not that I&#39;m complaining but hey. So 500$ a year for signing builds is a big no. I&#39;d like to eat something else than ramen noodles first, thank you.</p>
<p>You might think that I&#39;m a cheap bastard and that 500 bucks a year isn&#39;t all that much to have a few companies verify my identity and allow me to publish software to a global audience of a billion user. And to some extent, you&#39;ll be right.</p>
<p>But here&#39;s why I personnally think the code-signing system is broken: <strong><em>code-signing is a valuable security feature, and by putting it behind paywalls, small applications like eDEX are (voluntarily) made more dangerous to use.</em></strong></p>
<p>If you were hosting websites a few years back, you might remember that even for small ones, if you wanted to provide your users with HTTPS encryption - which is by now pretty much a requirement for any website that doesn&#39;t want to <a href="https://www.theregister.co.uk/2018/02/08/google_chrome_http_shame/">get flagged by browsers</a> - you had to buy an SSL certificate and those used to be crazy expensive,  hundreds a year for the basic stuff with no identity verification.</p>
<p align="center">
    <img alt="Letsencrypt logo" src="/posts/code-signing/res/Letsencrypt.png"/>
</p>

<p>Then, in 2016, <a href="https://letsencrypt.org">letsencrypt</a> came along. Suddenly, basic SSL certificates were free, and everyone started implementing HTTPS if they hadn&#39;t done so already. <strong>No need to say that the World Wide Web is a much safer place since then.</strong></p>
<p>So perhaps one day we&#39;ll have the letsencrypt of code-signing and desktop software will be safer for everyone. Until then, I&#39;ll have to keep shipping unsigned binary releases.</p>
