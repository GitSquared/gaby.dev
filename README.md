## gaby.dev

This is my personal website which hosts a bunch of links to my public online accounts, my resume, and a blog for when I feel like sharing something.

It also has a bunch of handy short-url redirects, like `gaby.dev/edex`.

It's all static html+css hosted on ZEIT's Now, because there is no need for anything else.

I'm currently working on porting my previous blog posts from my old url and writing a bunch of scripts to make creating new ones easy. In the meantime all the blog links redirect back to the old site.
